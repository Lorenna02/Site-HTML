    <p>Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called " <i>Pupin coils</i> ", followed closely on the pioneering work of the English physicist and mathematician <b>Oliver Heaviside</b> , 
        which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years. The importance of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by <i>American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T)</i> , 
        making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had their own development in hand led by <b>George Campbell</b> and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with Campbell's own patent. 
        AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability to greatly extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
